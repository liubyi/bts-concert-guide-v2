		    		Update: Some people have asked Rose Bowl about pins, and have gotten conflicted replies. I would just print out a list of prohibited items, 
		    		and if Rose Bowl says that pins aren't allowed inside just show them the list 
		    		(and make sure the pins aren't obscuring the inside of the bag, which is probably why some people have gotten replies that said the pins should be on the straps). 
		    		Hopefully there will be an official announcement.

		    		See the full guide <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/9jzxdo/how_to_stay_safe_during_concerts_events_and_while/" target="_blank"> here. </a>
		    	</List.Item>
		    	<List.Item>
		    		Do hourly check-ins with a friend/family member, especially if you're traveling alone or out late at night after the concert or camping for merch.
		    		You can also post regularly on Snapchat/Instagram so others know where you are.
		    	</List.Item>
		    	<List.Item>
		    		Put in contact information of the local police stations including phone numbers and addresses, your own personal emergency contacts, and various emergency hotlines
		    	</List.Item>
		    	<List.Item>
		    		Bring a charger and backup power bank. You will need your phone for Google maps or calling for Uber/Lyft. Save enough battery for after the concert.
		    	</List.Item>
		    	<List.Item>
		    		Walk fast with intention. 
		    		Like you know where you're going even if you don't. 
		    		If you are actually lost, stop in a safe area/store to look at your phone or ask someone, then repeat. 
		    		Don't look at your phone the entire time while walking; it's not safe. 
		    		You just don't want to look vulnerable and be an easy target. 
		    		Standing on a corner and staring at the buildings and looking at your phone map screams "I have no idea where I'm going." 
		    	</List.Item>
		    	<List.Item>
		    		Beware of people trying to trick you. Many try to appear like they are asking for help (a common one is asking you for bus fare so they can see you take out your money or for directions so they can see you pull out your phone, etc).
		    	</List.Item>
		    	<List.Item>
		    		"This might be a scary one, but I was at a concert at Barclays in Brooklyn and there was a gun scare that resulted in a stampede. A lot of people got hurt. I donâ€™t know the correct procedure, but we were told by security to kneel down and hide next to one of the food carts out of the way of the stampede and the unseen threat until it was over. This saved us from getting hurt and/losing our belongings."
		    	</List.Item>
		    	<List.Item>
		    		Do not go with anyone to a secondary location. Victims of violent crime are much more likely to go to a place willingly than with force - ie, someone invites you to a party or offers you a ride or something. 
		    	</List.Item>
		    	<List.Item>
		    		Don't make it obvious that you are traveling alone and don't easily give away personal information. If you come across a group of other fans, you can start by just simply asking if you can tag along with them instead of immediately publicly announcing somewhere that you're by yourself for the night. 
		    	</List.Item>
		    	<List.Item>
		    		Don't walk around in a sketcy area just to save a few bucks. Use Uber Pool or Lyft Shared rides if you need to save money. Your safety is more important than a few dollars.
		    	</List.Item>
		    	<List.Item>
		    		When using Lyft/Uber: BEFORE you get into the car, confirm the license plate, the driver, and ask who they're there to pick up. Don't introduce yourself until you confirm who they're picking up.
		    	</List.Item>
		    	<List.Item>
		    		Finally, be safe and have fun! There will be many ARMYs around before and after the concert, so it will be pretty safe. If you'll be alone, look on the Facebook group for someone from your high school/college who is also going, or make friends when you're in line. A lot of these are just precautions so you stay safe; it's not to deter you from traveling. :)
